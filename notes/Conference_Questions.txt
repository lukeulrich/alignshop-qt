Question: How to utilize a QSortFilterProxyModel on a source model that has different number of columns at different levels?
Context:  SliceModel
Problems: headers do not display properly and sorting from a QTableView by clicking on the headers does nothing

Question: Is it really necessary to do robust checking in all models? For example, in every method check that the indices
          belong to the current model, check ranges, check parents, etc. Is it safe to assume that if the index function
          only creates valid indices that all indices passed to these functions are safe to use? What about external use
          outside of "trusted" QAbstractItemView's?
Context:  QAbstractItemModel


Question: Is it advisable to add release mode guards after Q_ASSERTs? I suppose it matters how complete the debug testing is
          and if it is sufficient to trust all these cases. In release mode, without release guards = potential crash; with
          release guard - what is the result? Perhaps no crash, but potentially erratic behavior.
Context:  General

Question: What is the best way to incorporate printf-like arguments into macros like qWarning?
Context:  Conversion of QString to const char *
Problems: Currently, I have to convert from QString -> QByteArray -> const char * via QString().toAscii().constData(). This
          is awkard and long. Surely there is a better approach.

Bug?:     Switching between release and debug builds in QtCreator (Build | Set build configuration) does not actually change
          the build process to release or debug. Restarting does not correct this.


Bug?:     When switching the Qt libraries used to build a project, it is necessary to restart QtCreator before the change will
          take effect.

Question: Is there a quick way of converting a QList<int> -> QList<QVariant> or some other type?

Question: Using QSignalSpy is there any way to test the order of occurrence of multiple events? For instance, if Class A emits
          two signals, sigX and sigY, and both are emitted in response to some method call, can I determine if sigX came first
          or sigY?
