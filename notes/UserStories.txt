Sprint:
[L] User can import a sequence from a file.
Display full list, scroll, and select.
User can select a sub seq (record) which contains DNA sequence data.
Given a DNA sequence, user can select two primer-regions, which must be greater than N in lenth.
 - Wizard framework
 - Screen layout
 - Control to display DNA sequence and allow selection modifications.
 - Primer design criteria object/model
User can specify primer-finding parameters (CLARIFY)
 - Screen layout
 - Validation
 - Restriction enzyme browser
   - List restriction enzymes
   - Real-time filtering based on free-text (P2)
User can view ranked list of primer-pairs matching the criteria (region + parameters).
 - Kick off external tool, passing parameters from primer design criteria object/model.
 - Display progress/working indidcator.
 - Display results in a multi-select list, indicate how many are selected.
User can associate one or more of the primer-pairs with the original sub-seq.
 - Object to associate primers to sequence and save to DB.
User can view primer-pairs associated with a DNA sequence/sub-seq. (CLARIFY)
 - Sequence details screen (gotten to by selecting a sequence in the organizer view and clicking something?)



Schedule/Plan:
  Nov 30: Design, Task
  Nov 31: Work...
  Dec 21: Code complete, Integration, Manual tests/fixes
  Dec 22: Demo???



Product:
User can desgin a primer -------------------
 - User can select a sub seq (record) which contains DNA sequence data.
 - Given a DNA sequence, user can select two primer-regions, which must be greater than N in lenth.
 - User can specify primer-finding parameters (CLARIFY)
 - User can view ranked list of primer-pairs matching the criteria (region + parameters).
 - User can associate one or more of the primer-pairs with the original sub-seq.
 - User can send one or more primer-pairs to a primer vendor as a purchase order.
 - User can view primer-pairs associated with a DNA sequence/sub-seq.
User can import a sequence from a file.
User can add a sequence to the document/system.
User can import a sequence from web-service (CLARIFY).
User can find a sequence.
 - By phylogenetic tree.
 - By type (DNA, RNA, Protein/Amino Acid)
 - Free-text search auto-filters the list.
 - Display full list, scroll, and select.
 - By tag (CLARIFY)
 - BLAST: find via similar sequence (enter a sequence, and find similar), include reverse compliment???
 - Find DNA by protein.
 - By feature/advanced find: e.g. sequences longer than 500, named "foo" and starting with "bar", contains a transmembrane region, etc.
User can bulk edit (CLARIFY)
Tags.... (CLARIFY)
Extensibility -------------------------
  User can add plugins (EPIC)
  User can write QT scripts (EPIC)
Reading frame (translate between 3 char pairs and the amino acids)
Easily view reverse compliment.
