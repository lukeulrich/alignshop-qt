-- Use meaningful variable names for method arguments and include the type as part of the name. The full type should be
   spelled out except for the standard data types (unless the type is implicitly obvious). The names for these are
   outlined below:

   Type              Name
   ----              ----
   char              ch
   int               i
   char *            str

-- Class structure

   ** All methods should be alphabetized

   <public>
      constructors (copy constructor last)
      destructor
      public methods
      reimplemented methods
      operators
      reimplemented operators
      static methods
      public members
   <public slots>
   <signals>
   <protected>
   <protected slots>
   <private>
      private methods
      static private methods
      private variables
   <private slots>

-- Include order

   All Qt module names (e.g. QtCore, QtGui, QtSql, etc.) must be supplied when specifying a Qt class to utilize:

   <QtCore/QString>
   <QtGui/QFontMetrics>

   o Local includes must include any path information before the final filename if it is not present in the current
     directory. In other words, do not rely on the compiler include directories for locating the final file.

   o All Qt includes appear first, and then the local includes and each is alphabetically organized

-- NULL or 0?

   >> Answer: Neither. Use nullptr defined as a static const int

      static const int nullptr = 0;
