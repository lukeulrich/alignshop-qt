-- To build the custom blast+ files for use with AlignShop:

   1) Download the relevant blast+ source from NCBI. By relevant, I mean the
      blast+ version for which the patches are available. You can find the
      supported versions by simply looking for the version subdirectories.
      Currently, only 2.2.25 is supported.

      URL: ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/2.2.25/ncbi-blast-2.2.25+-src.zip

   2) Decompress to folder of choice
   3) Patch the source using the patch_source.pl script:

      $ ./patch_source.pl 2.2.25/ /path/to/decompressed/blast+/c++/

   4) Configure the blast+ package:

      ./configure --with-mt --without-debug --with-64 --with-lfs --with-strip

   5) ./make -j9

-- Psiblast did not respect the num_iterations, num_descriptions OR max_target_seqs arguments when outputting
   XML reports.
   1) include/algo/blast/format/blastxml_format.hpp

      Added nMaxHits parameter to BlastFormatReport method with default value
      of -1 (indicates no pruning)

   2) src/algo/blast/format/blastxml_format.cpp

      Added header to include blast_format.cpp (necessary for the Prune method)
      Added maxhits parameter to BlastXML_FormatReport
      Added maxhits parameter to the s_BlastXMLAddIteration method

   3) src/algo/blast/format/blast_format.cpp

      In PrintEpilog (method called for dumping XML data),
      pass the max hits from command line to the BlastXML_FormatReport method

-- Installing a fresh dev environment on windows (VS2010):

   o Download VS2010 @ http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express
     - Only includes the 32-bit version; however, that is sufficient for now


   o Download: opensource library for VS2008
   o Download: Qt-Creator

-- Bugfix: infinite progress loop when BLASTing very small databases that contained fewer sequences than the number of
   ticks (50).
